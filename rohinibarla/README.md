## About Me
I care for leading a balanced life and having joyful people around. Our minds are conditioned to live life using one of the few pre-defined templates. From the moment we are born, everyone is filling our minds with their impressions and opinions. Many structures are designed to condition the mind in a certain way. The primary being the schooling structure. The next being friends, parents, locality. And media to a larger extent on a day to day basis. After understanding all these influences and how our minds are conditioned, itâ€™s time to craft a process to lead a balanced life. And creating environments in which our children and young minds can blossom.
